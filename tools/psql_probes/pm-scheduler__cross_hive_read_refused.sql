-- cross_hive_read_refused (pm-scheduler, P-B, generated 2026-09-05 by tools/gen_cross_hive_read_recipes.py): every
-- hive-scoped table this page reads (pm_assets, pm_completions, pm_scope_items) must refuse a foreign hive in the DATABASE. RLS USING
-- clauses FILTER rather than raise, so the probe counts rows as a member of exactly one hive: a foreign hive with
-- rows reads 0, the member's own hive reads > 0 (the control). Fixtures are chosen live; a table with rows in
-- fewer than two hives reports 'n/a' and is excluded from the expectations by the generator.
